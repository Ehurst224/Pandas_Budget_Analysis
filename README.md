# Pandas_School_Budget_Analysis

This analysis was created to help make decisions regarding future school budgets. Interestingly, the less money that was spent per student produced higher math and reading scores. To go along with this trend, the charter schools (which are generally given less money than district schools) performed better in math and reading. Students in charter schools have a better chance of passing these subjects than students at district schools.
